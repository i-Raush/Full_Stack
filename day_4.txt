# Loops:-
	. JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
		. for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
		. Syntax:-  for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  				// code block to be executed
			    }
			Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
			Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
			Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

		. Example:- for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  				text += cars[i] + "<br>";
			     }


		. for/in - loops through the properties of an object
		. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
		. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
		. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
