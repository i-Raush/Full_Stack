# Hoisting:- . In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
	     . In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
	     . b = 10
	       console.log(b);
	       var b;
	     . Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
	     . Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax errror, so the code will simply not run.
