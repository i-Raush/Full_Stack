Authorization and Authentication

local storage and session storage
-> while logging in on facebook...facebook makes us store our content in its local storage....so we need not to login again even after closing the tabs.
-> when SBI makes us login it stotres our data on the session storage...that's why when we close the tab...we need to login again.
